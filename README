c++ class structure
===================

(X) Gob 
  - a definition for a graphic shape/object

(X) RectangleTemplate - extends Gob
  - generic rectangle template
  - has width, height
  - overrides fixbb (fix bounding box)
  - overrides xrange (drawing primitive)

(X) GobInstance - (concrete) - wrapper for Gob-instance, ie. rectangle
  - has Gob* (?), BoundingBox, InstanceData

Drawable - (concrete) storage for 
  - has base color, pivot point, and reference point (original Gob)
  - has bounding box
  - has at (Point), scale, heading
  - has displayable
  - has generic buffer (X)
  - (abstract) fixbb
  - (abstract) xrange

Rectangle - extends Drawable
  - has width, height
  - overrides fixbb (fix bounding box)
  - overrides xrange (drawing primitive)
  - a particular rectangle
  - has 4 point buffer
  - has step (?)

View 
  - does draw(Canvas, Drawable)

DrawableGroup - extends Drawable (applies to group)
  - has vector<Drawable *>
  - overrides fixbb (fix bounding box)
  - overrides xrange (drawing primitive)


Canvas -


FILE STRUCTURE
==============

primary
-------
dj_inst2.cpp,h - the mechanism that interacts with NaCl dealing with messages
dj_two.cc,h - the application logic -- the 'game state' mechanism

supporting
----------
canvas.h - low level interaction with bitmaps
view.h, cpp - logical to physical device units mapping
bitmap.h - reading fonts and bitmaps
ascii.h - hacked font
bb.h - bounding box logic
gob.h - graphic object, base class for renderable items
point.h - point class
rectangle.h, cpp - representation of rectangle (uses gob.h)
types.h - cruft



TODO
====
change tone based on square size
put boundaries on windows
fix zoom and pan
